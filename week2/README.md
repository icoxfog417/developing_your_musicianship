* Major Triads: Triad is set of three notes that the interval between these are major third. 
* Minor Triads: middle note takes down half step.

Major triads sounds bright, and minor triads sounds dark.

* one: Tonic
* four: Subdominant
* five: Dominant

Below this cycle is popular in the music.  

1. one -> four -> five -> one
2. one -> five -> four -> five -> one
3. four -> five -> four -> one
4. five -> four -> five -> one

one becomes tonal center.
